            Good morning everyone and all present here. I am standing before you all to share my thoughts about through my speech about nature. Nature is the world around us. We, all human beings depend on nature every time and for everything. Many people admire the beauty of nature and even they write many novels and poems on it, this is because the beauty of nature cannot be expressed in one single word or saying. It provides the humans, animals and all the living beings on the earth a place to live with the joy of natural resources
